## BPM Bizagi Assignment

The task for our team was to choose an area (in our case, cinematography), a local company and describe its possible processes. We decided to work on the pre-production stage and started collecting data on it, based on this we drew an as-is model in Bizagi. The next task after the as-is model was to improve it and drew a to-be model. Since I divided long processes into subprocesses, two more diagrams appear except to-be model itself. Models have been uploaded as an image png files.
